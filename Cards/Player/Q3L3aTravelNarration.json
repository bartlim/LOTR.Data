Should he be caught by Orcs again, you fear the enemy would come to know one of its prisoners to be a person of no small significance. \r\n\r\nHaving twice escaped pursuit, you cautiously approach the ruined structure to study the disposition of your foe. The decayed ruin seems to have been a signal tower of old, now serving as a haunt of evil things. \r\n"
