Its face curdles as if you’d fed it sourleaf. After pondering a moment, it asks pitifully “Kind masters looking for...Baggins?”\r\n\r\nYou nod impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Orcses go to hill of haunted stones with slaves. Baggins too, precious.”  His face suddenly lights up with an idea “Smeagol knows trails in woodses, gollum. Masters follow Smeagol to find... Baggins?”  The wretched creature, Smeagol, begins to crawl away with eager purpose. Noticing that you’re not following him, he pauses “Trust Smeagol?”</i>"
