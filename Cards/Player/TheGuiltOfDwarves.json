    "FlavorText": "Gloin’s conscience gnaws at him in the comfort of Beorn’s house. Bilbo was abducted while strolling to meet him, Gloin, because he’d been late arriving. To make matters worse, a group of strangers were now risking their lives over his failure.\r\n\r\nSomething in him gives, and Gloin makes up his mind. Age be damned! He knows enough of woodlore to find the trail of the brave strangers, and his axe is sharp enough to hew a few more spiders.\r",
