    "Text": "While the companions were focused on destroying the spiders' nest, a massive spider charged from the shadows. Moving with incredible speed despite its size, the monstrous creature pounced upon Bilbo! Arwen and Gl√≥in rushed to defend their friend, but it was too late. The spider spun sticky silken cords around the hobbit even as it bounded away to vanish into the depths of the forest."
