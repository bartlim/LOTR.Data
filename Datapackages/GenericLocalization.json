Goblins rush to gather the cocoons, loading them into carts. As the last of the cocoons are loaded, goblins begin to pull at the carts. With clanking and bouncing, the loaded caravan begins its return journey south.\r\n\r\nA hooded goblin approaches the orc leader in a panic, waving a parchment full of crude hashmarks.

You can’t help but feel that Bilbo and his captors have a part to play in the sudden din.\r\n\nYour suspicions mount as the forest show signs of giant spiderwebs. At first, only a few thick strands are seen between canopy and trunk, but the webbing quickly grows denser. Before long the sticky ropes are thick enough to block your path. \r\n\r\nAbout to hack away at the webbing, you sense a subtle shift in the shadows and glance up.\r\n\r\nOnly a few feet above your head, the myriad glare of malicious eyes observe you. Pinchers drip with ichor. Hairy bloated bodies tremble with anticipation.\r"
